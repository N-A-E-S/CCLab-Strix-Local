        <h1>WELCOME TO BEYOND THE STELLARIS PROJECT</h1>
        <h2>"Welcome aborad captian!"</h2>
        <p>How was the flight just then? From a thousand years' perspective, you may find this piece of "web work" quite
            primitive. However, this is precisely the thrust of the project</p>
        <p>
            As someone born in an era when the farthest place humanity had reached was the moon, I have no doubt that a
            thousand years from now, interstellar travel will become increasingly common under the surge of
            technological advancements. However, with the popularization of space travel, the commercialization of deep
            space exploration is likely inevitable.In our modern capitalist world, the prioritization of profit over
            passion has become increasingly prevalent, and nowhere is this shift more poignant than in the realm of
            space exploration.</p>
        <p> As I envisage space a thousand years hence, I see the likely dominance of corporate logos on spacecrafts,
            the
            strategic marketing of celestial bodies, and the prioritization of profit over discovery. The intrinsic joy
            of exploration might be overshadowed by financial motives, with space adventures tailored more to wealthy
            tourists than to intrepid explorers.As I ponder this future, nostalgia sweeps over me, taking me back to the
            golden age of space exploration during the Cold War era. Then, the spirit of venture was not just about
            reaching new heights but about surpassing the confines of our earthly existence.In those golden days, each
            launch was not just a mission; it was a legend of human resilience and the triumph of intellect. Astronauts
            were more than mere travelers; they were vanguards of the unknown. With their backs to the warm Earth and
            their faces set against the cold, vast cosmos, they embarked not just to chart the uncharted, but to unravel
            the mysteries of the universe, seeking our place in the grand tapestry of all that exists. Under the fierce
            competition between superpowers, the space race, inadvertently, unfurled the purest human motives: an innate
            curiosity and a relentless desire to push past the familiar frontiers</p>
        <p>Today, as the spirit of such exploration risks being overshadowed by commercial interests, I am compelled to
            act. This is why I am creating a p5 project dedicated to the spirit of space exploration—a digital time
            capsule designed to capture and preserve the essence of exploration for future generations. This project is
            not just a game; it's a beacon, a reminder of what it once meant to gaze starward with wonder and ambition.
        </p>
        <p>A thousand years from now, I want this game to be a relic of the past's aspirations, a testament to the era
            when space was a frontier to be revered, not a commodity to be exploited. It's my hope that this game will
            inspire those in the far future to look up from their corporate-dominated cosmos and remember the pure joy
            of exploration—the very essence of what it means to be human.In crafting this project, I am weaving a thread
            through time, connecting us to future explorers. It is an invitation to dream, to dare, and to discover,
            just as we once did. This projetct is my gift to the future—a spark that might one day reignite the flames
            of
            curiosity and adventure in a cosmos that might have forgotten them. Yet, I still believe that one day, the
            wholesome spirit of humanity will safeguard this belief until it comes true.</p>
