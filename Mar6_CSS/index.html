	<h3>Family: Domain Bacteria, kingdom archaebacteria, phylum korarchaeota, class fantasia, order amoria, family dependens, genus amorcella</h3>
	<h3>Habitat:A heart-shaped lake in Northern Europe</h3>
	<h3>Appearance:Hot pink, very small</h3>
	<h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
	<h3>They need love to survive, and their size, color and moving speed are all based on their mood. The happier they are, the more likely they are to duplicate themselves and reproduce.</div>

		<h3>What do we know so far about the creature?</h3>
	</div>
	<h3>They crave love! If they are not taken good care of, they will shrink and die.
	</h3>
	<h3>How do we interact with this creature?</h3>
	<h3>We give them our love to cultivate them. However, the more love it has accumulatively got, the faster it will move and itâ€™ll be harder for us to feed it. So please keep attention to it!</h3>
